# LoRa-Temperature-HomeAssistant
This is my first project repository for LoRa sensor pair for long range temperature measurement and integration to Home Assistant

First of all, I am not a software developer of any sort. I'm a Home Assistant enthusiastic and I can understand and fiddle around with simple software code. I was able to accomplish a relevantly simple setup to harness Heltec ESP32 LoRa V3 board pair for long range temperature measurement and integrate it to my Home Assistant instance. Both the hardware setup and the code are most likely not optimal in terms of temperature accuracy, battery preservation and cost-efficiency, but they seem to work.

For my use case, I'm measuring the nearby lake water temperature and delivering it 160 meters not fully line of sight:
